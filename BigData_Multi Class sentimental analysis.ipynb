I've attempted several times to ratify the issue with the original creditors and credit bureaus and they still reporting inaccurate, unverifiable information. I have disputed this item with the credit reporting agency and they reported you confirmed the account as valid. I honestly do not believe to ever have any relationship with this collection agency or original creditor. Also there are several inaccuracies with this account the way it's reporting and that's a total violation of FCRA and FDCPA laws and regulations.

Please evidence proof of the alleged debt, including the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. 6. Please provide a complete account history, including any charges added for collection activity.You have 30 days upon receipt of this letter to provide strict proof of contract. In the event you can not provide strict proof of contract, you must cease and desist any and all collection efforts and immediately remove any derogatory information reported to the consumer reporting agencies. In addition, you will need to provide me your agreement, in writing, that you are closing your file, ceasing collecting activity, and deleting all information related to this reference number from any and all credit reports youve furnished the information to. In the event you transfer this account to an attorney without providing proof of contract, and proving your claim, he/she will be immediate reported to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX for code of ethics violations.\"]))"
